	JQuery Basic, Effects & Advance

1.what is JQuery?

==>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

    HTML/DOM manipulation
    CSS manipulation
    HTML event methods
    Effects and animations
    AJAX
    Utilities


2.How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in JQuery,
JQuery Animation?

==>jQuery has several methods for CSS manipulation. We will look at the following methods:

   1. addClass() - Adds one or more classes to the selected elements
			example
$("button").click(function(){
  $("p:first").addClass("intro");
});


 2.   removeClass() - Removes one or more classes from the selected elements

			example
$("button").click(function(){
  $("p:first").remove("intro");
});


3.    toggleClass() - Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements

		example
$("button").click(function(){
  $("p").toggleClass("main");
});


    css() - Sets or returns the style attribute

syntex:-css("propertyname");
example:-$("p").css("background-color");


		ANIMATION

The animate() method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.

This method changes an element from one state to another with CSS styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to create an animated effect.

Only numeric values can be animated (like "margin:30px"). String values cannot be animated (like "background-color:red"), except for the strings "show", "hide" and "toggle". These values allow hiding and showing the animated element.

Tip: Use "+=" or "-=" for relative animations.

syntex:-(selector).animate({styles},speed,easing,callback)



3.How to create slider with animation?

jQuery UI consists of GUI widgets, visual effects, and themes implemented using jQuery, CSS, and HTML. jQuery UI is great for building UI interfaces for the webpages. jQueryUI provides us a slider control through the slider widget. Slider helps us to get a certain value using a given range. In this article, we will see how to animate a slider. The animate option when set to true will create an animation effect when you directly click at any point on the slider’s axis

Syntax:

$(".selector").slider(
   { animate: value }
);

Parameters: This option accepts three parameters as discussed below:

    boolean: If set to true, the slider will be animated. By default, the value is false
    string: The string value used to set the speed of the slider cursor. The available values are slow, normal, fast.
    number: The duration of the animation in milliseconds.
